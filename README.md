# Overview

1. The program uses the optimization method of Riemannian Gradient Descent (RGD) algorithm to do the tomography problem.
   The implementation follows from the arxiv

# Package dependence
1. use the optimization method of Momentum-inspired Factorized Gradient Descent (MiFGD) as the basis




# Usage

1. must create a directory ./calc and data stored in ./calc

2. python main_QST.py
